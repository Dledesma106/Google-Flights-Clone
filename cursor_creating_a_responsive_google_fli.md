I Need to create a new React project that uses Material UI

It's a technical challenge for a frontend position

This is the whole description they gave me

"Create a responsive version of Google Flights using React and https://rapidapi.com/apiheya/api/sky-scrapper."

Some other technologies that were requested in the job description are automated testing suites, like jest or mocha(I'd rather use Jest)
State management libraries(I want to use react Query with hook to each endpoint in the API)
Also, I'm not completely familiar with Google Flights and if we can use this in the app but it also requests for the development of tables with pagination, filtering and sorting, user preference saving for column selection and layout, and dynamic column filter with dropdown and autocomplete options, which I know how to do using React Table and localStorage,

So, can we start creating the React App?

---

**Cursor**

Absolutely! Here’s a plan to get you started on this technical challenge:

## 1. **Project Setup**
- **React** (with TypeScript for type safety)
- **Material UI** (for UI components)
- **React Query** (for state management and API data fetching)
- **React Table** (for advanced table features)
- **Jest** (for testing)
- **Axios** (for API requests)
- **localStorage** (for user preferences)

## 2. **Project Structure**
- `src/components/` – UI components (tables, filters, etc.)
- `src/pages/` – Main pages (e.g., Flights)
- `src/hooks/` – Custom hooks (e.g., for React Query)
- `src/api/` – API logic (Axios + RapidAPI integration)
- `src/utils/` – Utility functions (e.g., localStorage helpers)
- `src/tests/` – Test files

## 3. **Initial Steps**
1. **Create the React app** (with TypeScript)
2. **Install dependencies**: Material UI, React Query, React Table, Axios, Jest, etc.
3. **Set up Material UI theme**
4. **Set up React Query provider**
5. **Set up folder structure**

---

**Let’s start by creating the React app and installing the dependencies.**  
Would you like to use `npm` or `yarn`? (If you have a preference, let me know!)  
If not, I’ll default to `npm`.

**Next steps:**
1. Create the app:  
   ```sh
   npx create-react-app google-flights-clone --template typescript
   ```
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```sh
   cd google-flights-clone
   npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled @mui/icons-material react-query @tanstack/react-table axios
   npm install --save-dev jest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom @testing-library/user-event
   ```

**Ready to run these commands and set up the project?**  
Let me know if you want to proceed, or if you want me to run the commands for you!

```shellscript
   npx create-react-app google-flights-clone --template typescript
```

```shellscript
   cd google-flights-clone
   npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled @mui/icons-material react-query @tanstack/react-table axios
   npm install --save-dev jest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom @testing-library/user-event
```

I want to use Yarn for a project level package handling

---

**Cursor**

Great choice! Yarn is fast and reliable for project-level package management.

Here’s what we’ll do:

### 1. Create the React app with TypeScript template using Yarn:
```sh
yarn create react-app google-flights-clone --template typescript
```

### 2. Change into the project directory:
```sh
cd google-flights-clone
```

### 3. Install dependencies:
```sh
yarn add @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled @mui/icons-material @tanstack/react-query @tanstack/react-table axios
```

### 4. Install testing dependencies (as dev dependencies):
```sh
yarn add --dev jest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom @testing-library/user-event
```

**Would you like me to run these commands for you, or do you want to run them yourself?**  
Let me know how you’d like to proceed!

```shellscript
yarn create react-app google-flights-clone --template typescript
```

```shellscript
cd google-flights-clone
```

```shellscript
yarn add @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled @mui/icons-material @tanstack/react-query @tanstack/react-table axios
```

```shellscript
yarn add --dev jest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom @testing-library/user-event
```

Ok, here it says that the create react app command is deprecated and that I should use a framework

The one I use the most is Next.js, we'll be using that one? I'll delete the one that was just created

---

**Cursor**

Yes, that’s a great call! Next.js is now the recommended way to start new React projects, and it works perfectly with Material UI, React Query, and all the other libraries you want to use. It also gives you SSR/SSG, routing, and better performance out of the box.

**Let’s proceed with Next.js (with TypeScript and Yarn):**

### 1. Create a new Next.js app with TypeScript:
```sh
yarn create next-app google-flights-clone --typescript
```

### 2. Change into the project directory:
```sh
cd google-flights-clone
```

### 3. Install dependencies:
```sh
yarn add @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled @mui/icons-material @tanstack/react-query @tanstack/react-table axios
```

### 4. Install testing dependencies:
```sh
yarn add --dev jest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom @testing-library/user-event
```

---

**Go ahead and delete the previous app folder if you haven’t already.**  
Let me know when you’re ready, and I’ll help you set up the Next.js project structure and initial configuration!

```shellscript
yarn create next-app google-flights-clone --typescript
```

```shellscript
cd google-flights-clone
```

```shellscript
yarn add @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled @mui/icons-material @tanstack/react-query @tanstack/react-table axios
```

```shellscript
yarn add --dev jest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom @testing-library/user-event
```

Ok, Ido have a question, Next.js uses tailwind a lot, can we use tailwind and material ui together? or it makes no sense to use them together?\

---

**Cursor**

Great question! You **can** use Tailwind CSS and Material UI together in a Next.js project, and many teams do so for specific reasons. Here’s a quick breakdown:

---

### **When Does It Make Sense to Use Both?**

- **Material UI** provides a rich set of pre-built, accessible, and themeable React components (buttons, dialogs, tables, etc.).
- **Tailwind CSS** is a utility-first CSS framework that lets you rapidly style components with utility classes.

**Combining them can make sense if:**
- You want to use Material UI’s components for complex UI elements (tables, dialogs, pickers, etc.).
- You want the flexibility and speed of Tailwind’s utility classes for custom layouts, spacing, and quick tweaks.
- You want to override or extend Material UI’s styles with Tailwind for rapid prototyping or custom designs.

---

### **Potential Downsides**
- **Bundle size:** You’ll be including both libraries, which increases your CSS/JS bundle size.
- **Style conflicts:** Rare, but possible. Material UI uses JSS/emotion, Tailwind uses utility classes. Usually, they coexist well, but you may need to tweak specificity in rare cases.
- **Consistency:** If your team is large, mixing two styling paradigms can lead to inconsistent UI if not managed well.

---

### **Best Practice**
- Use **Material UI** for complex, interactive components.
- Use **Tailwind** for layout, spacing, and custom tweaks, especially where Material UI doesn’t provide a component or you want a custom look.
- You can even use Tailwind classes inside Material UI’s `sx` prop or `className` for custom styling.

---

**Summary:**  
It’s totally fine to use both, and it can be powerful! Just be mindful of consistency and bundle size.

---

**Would you like to set up both Tailwind and Material UI in your Next.js project?**  
If yes, I’ll guide you through the setup!

---

**User**

Yes please!

---

**Cursor**

Your Next.js project is now set up with:

- **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **Material UI**
- **React Query**
- **React Table**
- **Axios**
- **Jest & React Testing Library**

This is a modern, robust stack for your Google Flights challenge!

---

### **Next Steps**

1. **Verify Tailwind and Material UI are working together** (we’ll create a simple page with both).
2. **Set up React Query provider** in your app.
3. **Set up a basic folder structure** for components, hooks, and API logic.
4. **(Optional)** Configure Jest for custom test setup (if needed).

Would you like to:
- Start with a simple page that uses both Tailwind and Material UI to confirm everything works?
- Or set up the React Query provider and folder structure first?

Let me know your preference!
